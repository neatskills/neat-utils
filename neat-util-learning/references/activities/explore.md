# Explore Activity

**Purpose:** Build/expand concept map, understand relationships

**When to run:**
1. First session: build initial map
2. User asks about unknown concept: "What's StatefulSet?"
3. User requests expansion: "What else should I know?"

## Initial Map Building

**Input:** topic, goal, domain

**Process:**
1. AI generates concept list customized to goal
2. Organizes into sections (Foundation → Core → Advanced)
3. Sets dependencies (requires/enables)
4. Shows map to user for confirmation
5. Updates state with sections and concepts

**Output:** Populated map with concepts at Level 0, dependencies set

## Example: Kubernetes + "Deploy applications"

Sections:
- Foundation: Pod
- Workflow: Deployment, Service
- Configuration: ConfigMap, Secret
- Storage: Volume

Dependencies:
- Pod requires: container-basics
- Deployment requires: pod; enables: scaling, rolling-updates
- Service requires: pod; enables: ingress

## Example: Negotiation + "Salary negotiation"

Sections:
- Foundation: BATNA, Reservation price
- Tactics: Anchoring, Mirroring, Silence
- Strategy: Multi-issue negotiation, Time pressure

Dependencies:
- BATNA requires: none (foundation)
- Anchoring requires: BATNA; enables: salary-range-setting

## Adding Concepts Mid-Journey

**Trigger:** User asks "What's [X]?"

**Process:**
1. Check if X in current map → skip Explore, run Discover
2. If not in map: explain X briefly
3. Ask: "Should I add [X] to your map?"
4. If yes: determine section, set dependencies, add to state
5. If no: answer question but don't persist

**Output:** Map expanded with new concept at Level 0
